# **Visualizing Complex Numbers with Pythagoras**  

Hi, I'm Gaurav Powar, and I created the **Pythagoras** repository to help visualize complex numbers in a simple yet intuitive way. This project plots a triangle on the complex plane, using the points **0 (origin), 1 (real number), and i (imaginary unit)** as its vertices. My goal was to make it easier to see how these numbers relate to one another geometrically.  

## **Why I Built This**  

I've always been fascinated by the way mathematics can be represented visually. Complex numbers, in particular, have a reputation for being abstract, but when you plot them on a plane, their relationships become much clearer. I wanted to create something straightforward that anyoneâ€”whether a student or a math enthusiastâ€”could use to gain a better understanding of these concepts.  

## **Whatâ€™s in the Repository?**  

The **Pythagoras** repo consists of a few essential components:  

- **MatLab_Image.py** â€“ The main Python script that generates the triangle plot.  
- **README.md** â€“ A detailed guide on how to use the project.  
- **triangle_plot.png** â€“ A sample output image showing the plotted triangle.  

## **How It Works**  

The script makes use of **Matplotlib** to draw a triangle on the complex plane. The three vertices are:  

- **(0, 1)** â†’ Represents **i**, the imaginary unit.  
- **(1, 0)** â†’ Represents **1**, a real number.  
- **(0, 0)** â†’ Represents the **origin**.  

When you run the script, it will plot these points on a 2D plane, labeling the **Real Axis** and **Imaginary Axis** for clarity. The grid helps in visualizing their positions relative to each other.   

## **Final Thoughts**  

I built **Pythagoras** as a fun and educational tool for visualizing the geometric relationships of complex numbers. Whether you're a student trying to grasp the concept or just someone who enjoys playing with mathematical visualizations, I hope this project helps make complex numbers a little less "complex"!  

Feel free to check out the repo, try it yourself, and let me know what you think. ðŸš€
